# Maverick.js

Welcome to Maverick.js! Maverick.js, or Maverick for short, is a Node.js web framework, with a focus on clean structure and MVC oriented design patterns. Maverick is perfect for projects big or small, and borrows heavily from developed Ruby web frameworks such as Sinatra and Rails.

## Creating an application, and docuemntation

For information and documentation on how to create an application, or the API reference for Maverick, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/nathankleyn/maverick.js/wiki)

## Work In Progress

You've been warned: this is a work in progress, and literally so; as you are reading this, likely I am writing something new or doing something over again properly. Things that should work might not, and things that don't work will hopefully in the near future actually do something.

That said, please do feel free to contribute by raising issues if you spot something glaringly obvious. Over the coming months, I'll try to write up what I have in mind for this project, and will open the floodgates for other contributors and forks as soon as that has happened.
