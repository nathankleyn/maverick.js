A new application can be created by running `maverick create project_name`. This command will create a directory containing a barebones project structure for a Maverick project.

## Running an application

This will launch a server

## Work In Progress

You've been warned: this is a work in progress, and literally so; as you are reading this, likely I am writing something new or doing something over again properly. Things that should work might not, and things that don't work will hopefully in the near future actually do something.

That said, please do feel free to contribute by raising issues if you spot something glaringly obvious. Over the coming months, I'll try to write up what I have in mind for this project, and will open the floodgates for other contributors and forks as soon as that has happened.

## License

At the moment, until I have everything written up properly in the way of coding styles and architectural plans, consider this copyright to me, Nathan Kleyn, with no licence for derivitives.
